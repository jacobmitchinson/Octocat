Git clone creates a copy of the a repo within a new directory. This copy is an exact clone of the original repo and includes details of the commit history along with the files. Additionally, the source repo (usually named 'origin') can be remotely tracked such that 'git fetch' will fetch the details of the log history and 'git merge' will merge the files ('git pull' will do this in one command).
